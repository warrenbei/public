To solve all possible 163 puzzles (make 163 from 5 numbers in [1,13] with +-*/) efficiently without duplicate equations

lemma: intermediate results as rational functions satisfy
(1) the numerator and denominator are linear in all variables,
(2) the coefficients are +-1, and
(3) they don't share any common terms
proof: trivial induction

1.
polynomial handler: represent a polynomial as a bitmask of bitmasks
to compress a-b+ab: let the term-bitmasks be -1 -> 0, a -> 1, b -> 2, ... so the terms are a (2), -b (5), and ab (6)
polynomial bitmask is 2^2+2^5+2^6; 5 variables fits perfectly in 2^64

2.
rational function handler: just store the two polynomials
all four operations are ridiculously fast with bitwise operators

3.
for each valid RPN equation (3584 total), for each permutation of variables:
compute the rational function and normalize the signs
see which one's result is lexicographically smallest, this rational function is the "canonical form"
for instance (a-b)*(c-d) and (b-d)*(c-a) have the same canonical form so they're found to be duplicates
delete duplicates, now there's one copy of each distinct equation

4.
for each equation and quintuple of unsorted numbers evaluate it
if 163 then store this string in the answers to the sorted tuple (a big answer table)
then print them; no duplicate strings or redundant solutions

Actual program will be written later
